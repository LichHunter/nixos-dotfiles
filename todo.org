Need to be fixed

Fixed by removing plasma completly :)
* DONE Fix emacs
CLOSED: [2024-01-20 Sat 22:03]
Currently after upgrade by default we are running emacs 29.1 but our emacs from terminal is version 28.2
So we can't use shortcut to open it

For now I'm just going to add emacs daemon to the hyprland config, to start it on login

* DONE Fix multi monitors
CLOSED: [2024-04-03 Wed 17:39]
Currently I added wlr-randr and [[https://github.com/cyclopsian/wdisplays][wdisplays]] but this needs to be done either with autorandr but for wayland or with hyprland (in this case) itself
So when I've changed it like hypr wiki says using config - after reboot it crashed, so I think monitors option would not work here
* DONE Add hyprland tabbed layout
CLOSED: [2024-04-03 Wed 18:27]
Seems not going to be fixed for now
In wiki we have some kind of other tabbed layout but it sucks comparing to i3/sway

Added shortcuts for dwindle layout as it called in hyprland
But it still bad
* DONE Issue when locking in other then english language
CLOSED: [2024-04-08 Mon 15:33]

* DONE Issue when laptop sits for a while
CLOSED: [2024-06-14 Fri 11:16]
After some time laptop will freez and stop respond

Seems to be issue of impermanence, as now after migration to normal nixos issue was fixed
* DONE [#C] Fix hyprland crashing on start

No idea what is going on
Seems to be fixed in late updates

* DONE Hypr crashes on login if kde is removed <<issue>>
CLOSED: [2024-06-14 Fri 11:20]
Possible [[https://www.reddit.com/r/hyprland/comments/16ls2pn/nixos_hyprland_crashing_on_startup/][solution]]
Possible this error somewhat related to xdg-portals and gtk...

Seems to be fixes by removing from xserver hyprland config
#+begin_src nix
xdg.portal = {
    enable = true;
    extraPortals = [ pkgs.xdg-desktop-portal-gtk ];
};
#+end_src

Sooo, seems like I havent fixed it at the end, as after nixos-switch I'm crashing again but other times are ok

Or not, just rebuilt and everything is ok...
No Idea what is going on
Will leave it as it is
Looks like fixed in late update too
* DONE Fix suggesstion window in IDEA for hypr
CLOSED: [2024-06-14 Fri 11:21]
Possible solution
https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland/issues/3450#issuecomment-1816761575

Looks like fixed for now

CLOSED: [2024-06-14 Fri 11:38]
* DONE Add distrobox.conf file to nixos configs
CLOSED: [2024-06-14 Fri 11:39]
* DONE User username parameter instead of variable
CLOSED: [2024-06-14 Fri 11:49]
I've added username to the flake and now would need to do some refactoring to use it instead of username from variables.nix as it seem to be better way to manage username variable
* DONE Latest update broke theming...
CLOSED: [2024-06-20 Thu 22:14]
Rolling back to previous version fixed it.
Created issue to get help - https://github.com/danth/stylix/issues/430

Fixed stylix. As I mentioned in issue, there were a commit with change of accent colors for GTK, as it doesn't work for me I've forked project and reverted change.
Now will need to periodically update fork to keep up with upstream.
Also finally fixed image.png.drv issue. It was related to "image.png" not exising (before it worked fine before tho...), so now I use exising wallpaper in repo.
I don't think it changes anything in hyprland at all so will leave it as it is for now
* DONE Add readme
CLOSED: [2024-06-28 Fri 19:52]
* TODO [#C] Try this rice [[https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/196cdc1/hyprland_nixos_catppuccin_first_time_ricing_and/][link]]
* TODO Fix emms in emacs
For not I get some strage permission error but in ncmpcpp everything works fine
* TODO Fix kanshi profiles to settings
trace: warning: omen profile: kanshi.profiles option is deprecated. Use kanshi.settings instead.
* TODO Add hyprland move window from one screen to another
* TODO Move out mbsync from home.nix to another file
* TODO Fix icons in waybar
* TODO Fix split-workspaces are broken for now with latest version of hypland
Will need to wait for https://github.com/Duckonaut/split-monitor-workspaces/pull/96 to be merged
As I understood this will fix it
* TODO Look at nix fmt error
After running `nix fmt` to format code git is no longer able to commit changes
* TODO Change doom font to properly shot italy text
* TODO Add fractional scalling
From what I can see I can do it either in kanshe or hyprland but as I'm using kanshi for autodetection of displays I think this should be there
* TODO Fix building with sudo
After building system with sudo I can't run 'nix develop' or other commands without removing cache first

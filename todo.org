Need to be fixed

Fixed by removing plasma completly :)
* DONE Fix emacs
CLOSED: [2024-01-20 Sat 22:03]
Currently after upgrade by default we are running emacs 29.1 but our emacs from terminal is version 28.2
So we can't use shortcut to open it

For now I'm just going to add emacs daemon to the hyprland config, to start it on login
* TODO Hypr crashes on login if kde is removed <<issue>>
Possible [[https://www.reddit.com/r/hyprland/comments/16ls2pn/nixos_hyprland_crashing_on_startup/][solution]]
Possible this error somewhat related to xdg-portals and gtk...

Seems to be fixes by removing from xserver hyprland config
#+begin_src nix
xdg.portal = {
    enable = true;
    extraPortals = [ pkgs.xdg-desktop-portal-gtk ];
};
#+end_src

Sooo, seems like I havent fixed it at the end, as after nixos-switch I'm crashing again but other times are ok

Or not, just rebuilt and everything is ok...
No Idea what is going on
Will leave it as it is

Need to be fixed

Fixed by removing plasma completly :)
* DONE Fix emacs
CLOSED: [2024-01-20 Sat 22:03]
Currently after upgrade by default we are running emacs 29.1 but our emacs from terminal is version 28.2
So we can't use shortcut to open it

For now I'm just going to add emacs daemon to the hyprland config, to start it on login

* DONE Fix multi monitors
CLOSED: [2024-04-03 Wed 17:39]
Currently I added wlr-randr and [[https://github.com/cyclopsian/wdisplays][wdisplays]] but this needs to be done either with autorandr but for wayland or with hyprland (in this case) itself
So when I've changed it like hypr wiki says using config - after reboot it crashed, so I think monitors option would not work here
* DONE Add hyprland tabbed layout
CLOSED: [2024-04-03 Wed 18:27]
Seems not going to be fixed for now
In wiki we have some kind of other tabbed layout but it sucks comparing to i3/sway

Added shortcuts for dwindle layout as it called in hyprland
But it still bad
* DONE Issue when locking in other then english language

* TODO Hypr crashes on login if kde is removed <<issue>>
Possible [[https://www.reddit.com/r/hyprland/comments/16ls2pn/nixos_hyprland_crashing_on_startup/][solution]]
Possible this error somewhat related to xdg-portals and gtk...

Seems to be fixes by removing from xserver hyprland config
#+begin_src nix
xdg.portal = {
    enable = true;
    extraPortals = [ pkgs.xdg-desktop-portal-gtk ];
};
#+end_src

Sooo, seems like I havent fixed it at the end, as after nixos-switch I'm crashing again but other times are ok

Or not, just rebuilt and everything is ok...
No Idea what is going on
Will leave it as it is
